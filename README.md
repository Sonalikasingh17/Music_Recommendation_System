#  Music Recommender System

A lightweight **content-based music recommendation app** built with Python, utilizing **TF-IDF** and **cosine similarity** to suggest similar songs.  
Deployed with **Streamlit**, this tool offers fast and intuitive song recommendations based on the **Spotify Million Song Dataset**.

---

##  Features

- **Content-based Recommendations**  
  Uses TF-IDF vectorization on lyrics/text features and cosine similarity to suggest similar tracks.

- **Lightweight & Git-friendly**  
  Avoids large `.pkl` files. Only `df_cleaned.pkl` and `tfidf_matrix.pkl` are committed‚Äîcosine similarity is computed dynamically at runtime.

- **Streamlit App with Attractive UI**  
  - Styled banner header and recommendation cards  
  - Spinner feedback and emojis for interactivity  
  - Built-in song search via dropdown (with optional autocomplete)

##  Project Structure

-  preprocess.py # Preprocesses raw data, creates TF-IDF matrix
-  recommend.py # Computes and serves recommendations
-  main.py # Streamlit app interface
-  df_cleaned.pkl # Cleaned DataFrame (generated)
-  tfidf_matrix.pkl # TF-IDF feature matrix (generated)
-  requirements.txt # Python dependencies

##  Dataset

This project uses the [**Spotify Million Song Dataset (Lyrics Data)**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/notshrirang/spotify-million-song-dataset/data) from Kaggle.  

- The dataset contains **song lyrics and metadata** (artist, track, link).  
- In this project:
  - The `text` (lyrics) column is cleaned and preprocessed with **NLTK**.  
  - A **TF-IDF matrix** is built from the cleaned text.  
  - **Cosine similarity** is calculated to recommend top-N similar songs.  

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Due to size, the dataset itself is **not included in this repository**. Please download it from Kaggle if you want to preprocess it yourself.

##  Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sonalikasingh17/Music_Recommender_System.git
   cd Music_Recommender_System
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Download Dataset**

    Download the dataset from Kaggle:

    üëâ [**Spotify Million Song Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/notshrirang/spotify-million-song-dataset/data)

4. **Run Preprocessing**
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
- This script cleans the dataset and saves:
  - df_cleaned.pkl
  - tfidf_matrix.pkl

5. **Launch the Streamlit app**
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
    ```
   Open the local URL in your browser to explore the app.

## Tips & Customization

- Autocomplete Search Bar: Enhance the select box with st.selectbox(..., help="Type to search...") or use st.text_input() + fuzzy matching for better UX.
- Custom Styling: Modify CSS in main.py to refine recommendation cards (colors, fonts, spacing).
- Data Customization: Replace df['text'] preprocessing logic to work with lyrics, metadata, or genre features.
